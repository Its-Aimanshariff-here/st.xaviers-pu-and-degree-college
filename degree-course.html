                <H2> Enter the Blockchain Industry</H2><P>
                    Blockchain is one of the most promising industries out there. To those out there who are not too familiar with blockchain — a blockchain is a system of recording and storing information. This information is stored to make it very difficult to hack and corrupt.

So, for example, using blockchain technology, you can store the accounting transactions of a company on many devices. The data is duplicated and divided all over the computer network. Therefore, since the information is not recorded on one server or computer, it is tough to tamper with the data stored on the blockchain.

A job as a blockchain developer is highly lucrative as the demand for this new technology is just starting. Such courses focus on Ethereum, Composer, Solidity, core backend development, Java, and smart contracts
